# UDP Python Server 
I was learning how to make a server! :smile: 

To run, go to the root directory of this folder. 

Open terminal and enter the following commands
```markdown
python server.py
```

Open another terminal window, navigate to the root directory and enter the following: 
```markdown
python client.py 127.0.0.1 12000
```
Then it will show the PING, RTT, Average RRT, Max RRT and packet loss. 
### Please note: IP address & Port no. are an example only.
